					<h2>JaduPc Computer Lab</h2>
					
					<p>
						Setup Computer labs with JaduPc. We are helping various NGOs and school all around Bangladesh to setup computer labs for school going children. Only 2% of all rural households in Bangladesh have access to computers. Majority of children in rural areas have no access to useful digital literacy. JaduPc hopes to create a major impact in ensuring computer access all around Bangladesh with small school lab setups.
